        <li> Pickleball was invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, Washington, by three fathers who wanted
            to create a new game for their children to play.
        </li>
        <li>
            The game was named after the founder's dog, a cocker spaniel named Pickles, who would often chase after the
            ball during their matches.
        </li>

            Pickleball is a combination of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. It is played on a court that is one-third
            the
            size of a tennis court.
        </li>
        <li>
            The paddles used in pickleball are typically made of wood, composite materials, or graphite, and are
            slightly
            larger than the paddles used in ping-pong.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ball used in pickleball is similar to a Wiffle ball, with holes on the surface to reduce its speed and
            increase its flight time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pickleball is a popular sport among seniors, as it is easier on the joints and requires less physical
            exertion
            than other sports like tennis.
        </li>
        <li>
            The USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) was founded in 1984, and the first national tournament was held in
            2009.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pickleball is now played in over 5,000 locations across the United States, and it is also gaining popularity
            in
            other countries like Canada, Australia, and Spain.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 2021, pickleball was added to the Olympic program for the first time, as a demonstration sport in Tokyo.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are many variations of pickleball, including singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, as well as different
            scoring systems and rule sets.
